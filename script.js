  Tell us about your project below!ðŸ‘‡

  I wanted to do something related to art. Creating one space where all museums 
  could be accessed seemed like a pretty cool thing to do. So the idea here is
  to offer a museum experience to the end user that simplifies virtual museums.
  Instead of visiting each museum's website to see their works, you can just
  connect to one museum's website and see every museum's body of hosted works.

  To this end, I've chosen to connect to two APIs:
  1. The Art Institute of Chicago (https://api.artic.edu/docs/)
  2. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (https://metmuseum.github.io/)

  My project mimics the user experience in a museum website as closely as possible.
  First, the user types in the name of an artist they'd like to see art of. I did
  consider trying to make it so you could search by the name of a work in addition
  to searching by artist, but there were some technical issues that arose so I decided
  to keep it simple for this first run. Therefore, the input field will only accept
  artist names.

  We then take that input and use each museum's API to return the relevant data,
  including the image URL for each work, and merge them into a single array, which we
  then use to visualize on the page.

  The things I wanted to do that I didn't have time to do included adding in the 
  relevant artwork information to the card, like its title, year, classification 
  and medium, like a  proper museum might have next to the work. But you know how
  these things go: the design in your head and the clock on the wall don't always
  align. Do what you can with the time you have and move on from there.

  If I were to keep this project going, I would begin sourcing other museum APIs
  to connect to and really turn this thing into a global library that encompasses
  every piece of art that's publicly available and not held in some private collection
  that no one will ever see. I tried connecting to the API at the Louvre museum
  (https://collections.louvre.fr/en/page/documentationJSON) but I ran into a CORS
  error that I just didn't have enough time to figure out. But that would have been
  a great addition to this thing.

  Overall, I learned a ton and will absolutely use what I've learned in this class
  in my professional career. This shit is not easy, it takes a minute to really wrap
  your head around some of this stuff, but Jeremiah and Dani made it possible for
  an old man like me to learn a few new tricks.
